A mini-project to practice functional programming and play around with Haskell.

I used Fold, filter, zip, explicit recursion, pattern-matching, Function composition, conditionals, and
lambda expressions (I enjoy using them in Python, so I wanted to practice them in Haskell).

I implemented a dictionary data structure and created a driver program that performs grade management.

main.hs			- Driver
MyDictionary.hs	- Dictionary implementaton
